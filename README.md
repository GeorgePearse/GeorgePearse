### About Me 

I write about Machine Learning, Analytics and Start-Ups at https://medium.com/@george.pearse

I studied Physics, then I became a Data Engineering Consultant (Flask + SQL + AWS for orchestration), then I joined a Computer Vision start-up (behold.ai) where I've done a mixed bunch. Set-up the Modern Data Stack but also focused on data-centric-ai via active learning (pytorch-lightning and BAAL) and corrupt sample discovery (cleanlab esk techniques). I've also recently become much more involved in the MLOps community (speaking in the London stream on the 13th October 2022). 

Over the next few months I plan to generalise further, potentially by learning a front-end framework like svelte. I want to build end-end ML apps, eventually for real problems but initially for toy ones. 

Keen to start consistently contributing to open-source projects too and to try the "rootski approach" and to try to build a small, revenue generating app, fully in the open. 

I'm currently working on:
* Streamlit app for business intelligence (save SQL for transformations, plotly code for plotting).
* Quickdraw app via Streamlit (to try out some computer vision ideas).
* Active Learning via bagged ensemble disagreement. 
* Lightweight UIs for the QDrant Vector Database (and all things QDrant because they build excellent tools) https://github.com/GeorgePearse/QDrant-NLP

I'm talking at MLOps London on the 13th of October. Will demo QDrant-NLP there.
