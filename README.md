### About Me 

I studied Physics, then I became a Data Engineering Consultant (Flask + SQL + AWS for orchestration), then I joined a Computer Vision start-up (behold.ai) where I've done a mixed bunch. Set-up the Modern Data Stack but also focused on data-centric-ai via active learning (pytorch-lightning and BAAL) and corrupt sample discovery (cleanlab esk techniques). I've also recently become much more involved in the MLOps community. 

Over the next few months I plan to generalise further, potentially by learning a front-end framework like svelte. I want to build end-end ML apps, eventually for real problems but initially for toy ones. 

Keen to start consistently contributing to open-source projects too. Also keen to try the rootski approach and to try to build a small, revenue generating app, fully in the open. 

I'm currently working on:
* Streamlit app for business intelligence (save SQL for transformations, plotly code for plotting).
* Quickdraw app via Streamlit (to try out some computer vision ideas).
* Active Learning via bagged ensemble disagreement. 
* Lightweight UIs for the QDrant Vector Database (and all things QDrant because they build excellent tools) https://github.com/GeorgePearse/QDrant-NLP

I'm talking at MLOps London on the 13th of October. Will demo the QDrant UI there.
